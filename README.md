# Source-Connect

  -- Description --

Source Connect is a database builder and explorer designed to make it easier to build, explore, and maintain
a research database consisting of varous sources.

Instead of using a purely higherarchical, folder-type organization of the sources, the organizational model
used aims to emulate the ways data storage and access work in the human brain, as we experience them conciously.

The organizational scheme aims is to combine higherarchy with connectivity:

Higherarchy:
When we look up a keyword or key phrase/question corresponding to a topic, the search should return lists of 
topics of a broader nature, or supertopics (ex: "Canada" when looking up "Canadian Economy") and those of a more
specific nature, or subtopics (ex: "Canada Trade Agreements" when looking up "Canadian Economy").

For a given topic, the sources relevant to that topic (associated with all sub-topics) will be returned for 
access, and the returned broader and more specific topics can be used to broaden or narrow the source search results. 

Connectivity:
The listed sources can and often will be associated with multiple topics, which will be sued as the search phrases. 
The sources will not fall exclusively under one "folder" with the topic as the title, but will rather be associated 
with many topics. This will allow the searchability of the sources to go beyond what is possible by simply using words 
contained in the text or title of a source. It will allow certain connections to be made, stored, and later used when 
we forget about them, that can only be made by human beings who can read, interpret, and fully appreciate human language.
