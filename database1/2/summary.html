<p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This Report on the Protection of Civilians in the Armed Conflict in Iraq is published jointly by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). It covers the period of 1 May to 31 October 2015.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Civilians continue to suffer the most from from the non-international armed conflict in Iraq. From 1 January 2014 through 31 October 2015, UNAMI/OHCHR recorded at least 55,047 civilian casualties as a result of the conflict, with 18,802 people killed and 36,245 wounded.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">During the reporting period, from 1 May to 31 October 2015, the ongoing violence caused a minimum of 10,911 civilian casualties, killing at least 3,855 persons and wounding 7,056. </span><span style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">Baghdad </span><span style="font-style: italic;">was the most affected governorate, with a minimum of 6,168 civilian casualties (1,875 killed and 4,293 wounded), followed by </span><span style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">Anbar </span>(452 killed and 1,421 wounded) <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">Diyala </span>(658 killed and 918 wounded).</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Owing to difficulties in undertaking verification of incidents recorded by UNAMI/OHCHR, the actual number of civilian causalities could be much higher than recorded. Figures for casualties in Anbar Governorate (which cover the full reporting period except for October 2015) were provided by the Anbar Health Directorate and might not fully reflect the actual number of casualties in those areas due to the increased volatility of the situation there and the disruption of services.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In addition, the number of civilians who have died from the secondary effects of armed conflict and violence &ndash; such as lack of access to basic food, water or medical care &ndash; is unknown.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Civilians continue to flee their homes and communities in massive numbers. From January 2014 through 29 September 2015, a total of 3,206,736 persons became internally displaced in Iraq, including over 1 million school age girls and boys. 87 per cent of these internally displaced persons (IDPs) originate from three governorates &ndash; Anbar, Ninewa, and Salah al-Din. The persistent violence and scale of the displacement continue to impact IDPs&rsquo; access to basic services, such as housing, clean water and education.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The violence suffered by civilians in Iraq remains staggering. The so-called &ldquo;Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&rdquo; (ISIL) continues to commit systematic and widespread violence and abuses of international human rights law and humanitarian law. These acts may, in some instances, amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and possibly genocide.</span><span style="font-style: italic;">1</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">During the reporting period, ISIL killed and abducted scores of civilians, often in a targeted manner. Victims include those perceived to be opposed to ISIL ideology and rule; persons affiliated with the Government, such as former Iraqi security forces (ISF), police officers, former public officials and electoral workers; professionals, such as doctors and lawyers; journalists; and tribal and religious leaders. Others have been abducted and/or killed on the pretext of aiding or providing information to Government security forces. Many have been subjected to adjudication by ISIL self-appointed courts which, in addition to ordering the murder of countless people, have imposed grim punishments such as stoning and amputations.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">ISIL continues to target members of different ethnic and religious communities, systematically persecuting these groups and subjecting them to a range of abuses and violations. These acts exemplify ISIL apparent policy of suppressing, permanently expelling, or destroying some communities. Women and children remain particularly vulnerable, with ongoing reports of sexual</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">violence, including sexual slavery, and the forcible recruitment and use of children in hostilities. ISIL</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">severely restricts all fundamental rights and freedoms across all areas under its control.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">ISIL has continued to attack civilian and protected objects in the conduct of its operations. Sites of religious and cultural significance are particularly targeted. Civilian homes have also been destroyed, sometimes because they belonged to members of groups targeted by ISIL, or to relatives or perceived sympathizers of those fighting ISIL. Reports on the use of chemical weapons continue to be received, although these could not be verified by UNAMI/OHCHR.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">UNAMI/OHCHR also continued to receive reports of violations and abuses of international human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by ISF and associated forces, including militia and tribal forces (Shi&rsquo;a, Sunni and others), popular mobilization units (PMUs), and Peshmerga (pro- Government forces).</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Concerning reports have been received of unlawful killings and abductions perpetrated by pro- Government forces. Some of these incidents may have been reprisals against persons perceived to support or be associated with ISIL.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Moreover, as civilians move around the country, fleeing violence, they have continued to face Government restrictions on their ability to access safe areas. Once they reach such areas, some have experienced arbitrary arrest in raids by security forces and others have been forcibly expelled.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The conduct of pro-Government forces&rsquo; operations raises concern that they are carried out without taking all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects. In particular, UNAMI/OHCHR continued to receive reports of civilian casualties caused by airstrikes. Reports have also been received of pro-Government forces apparently deliberately destroying civilian infrastructure.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In a number of cases, it has been impossible to identify the perpetrators of violations and abuses committed, largely within liberated areas under Government control, during the reporting period. These include instances of murder, intimidation and threats, abductions, and the use of improvised explosive devices, vehicle-born improvised explosive devices, and suicide bombers to target civilians or civilian infrastructure.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Serious concerns for the well-being of civilians, particularly the most vulnerable, persist. Parties to the conflict must take all feasible precautions to protect civilians from the effect of hostilities and take all necessary measures to respect, protect, and meet the basic needs of the civilian population. Violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law must be investigated by the Government of Iraq effectively, promptly, thoroughly, and impartially.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Government of Iraq is again strongly urged to undertake legislative amendments to grant Iraqi courts jurisdiction over international crimes and to become a party to the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) or to refer the current situation in Iraq to the ICC. In addition, as soon as practicable after the re-taking of areas from ISIL control, the Government of Iraq should ensure that responsibility for law and order is restored to civilian control and that the human rights and basic</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">humanitarian needs of civilians in those areas are met.</span></span></span></p>
